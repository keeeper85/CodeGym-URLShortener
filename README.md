# CodeGym-URLShortener
Project at the end of level 36. Using different strategies and learning about different types of maps I made an app to shorten String variables. 

 
- Add a strategy for working with a database. Google JDBC.
- Make a web service that returns an identifier for any URL or string, and returns the string for an identifier.
- Write a version of HashMap that uses two threads, where one thread is responsible for working with elements, and the second is responsible for monitoring the number of elements. When the number of elements exceeds a threshold, the second thread should double the size of table. Additionally, the first thread should not know anything about the threshold.
  
And also:
- Strategy pattern.
- Guava library.
- Apache Commons Collections.
- JUnit for testing.
